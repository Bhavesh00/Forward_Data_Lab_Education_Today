My research interests lie in the area of computer security and privacy, especially as applied to large-scale distributed systems. My current focus is on anonymity: analysis of existing anonymous systems and the design of new peer-to-peer anonymous networks. In this research I take a systems approach, with rigorous, quantitative metrics of anonymity and analysis with help from simulations. I also work on other privacy enhancing technologies, such as techniques for privacy-preserving data aggregation, as well as research into building reliable and secure peer-to-peer networks. 3

I lead the FORWARD Group , which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories , at the CS department of UIUC. Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured big data --- to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world's information. Therefore, our research spans across data mining, data management/databases , information retrieval, machine learning , with current efforts focusing on interactive data management, entity-centric Web search and mining, social media analytics, and social network mining. As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data. 0
I am looking for PhD/MS students to join the research project at the FORWARD Lab . Our current projects studies theories and algorithms as well as build systems for real world data management applications for Web search/mining and social media analytics. Take a look at our recent publications to see what we work on. 0
Our FORWARD Lab welcome undergraduate students to participate in research with us. You will join our projects to work with graduate students for design algorithms and implement systems in data management, data mining, and social media/network analytics. 0

The spectacular CMOS technology scaling has created a large design productivity gap due to inherent design complexities and deep submicron issues. Development cost, including both the design cost and manufacturing cost, of integrated circuits has grown significantly given the increasing size of the design team and the lengthy design cycles. Meanwhile, intensive computational demands arising from emerging workloads, such as those in various IoT and deep-learning related domains, require new architecture and hardware designs, novel automated design flows, and efficient accelerator deployments both at the edge and in the cloud. In this context, the research group led by Prof. Chen mainly pursue the following research directions: system-level and high-level design automation, machine learning and cognitive computing, hardware/software co-design, and FPGA and GPU computing. The group recently is also pursuing several other research directions, such as computational genomics and security and computation in the smart grid. 0

Mark Hasegawa-Johnson has been on the faculty at the University of Illinois since 1999, where he is currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He received his Ph.D. in 1996 at MIT, with a thesis titled "Formant and Burst Spectral Measures with Quantitative Error Models for Speech Sound Classification," after which he was a post-doc at UCLA from 1996-1999. Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson is a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, and a Senior Member of IEEE and ACM. He is currently Treasurer of ISCA, and Senior Area Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language. He has published 280 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers in the general area of automatic speech analysis, including machine learning models of articulatory and acoustic phonetics, prosody, dysarthria, non-speech acoustic events, audio source separation, and under-resourced languages. 2
Professor Hasegawa-Johnson typically teaches Artificial Intelligence (CS 440/ECE 448), Multimedia Signal Processing (ECE 417), and Speech and Image Analysis (ECE 401). He has also taught Speech Processing (ECE 537), Digital Signal Processing (ECE 551), Audio Engineering (ECE 403), Pattern Recognition (ECE 544NA), and Probability (ECE 313). 2
Dr. Hasegawa-Johnson's research is focused on the area of automatic speech recognition, with a particular focus on the mathematization of linguistic concepts. In the past five years, Dr. Hasegawa-Johnson's group has developed mathematical models of concepts from linguistics including a rudimentary model of pre-conscious speech perception (the landmark-based speech recognizer), a model that interprets pronunciation variability by figuring out how the talker planned his or her speech movements (tracking of tract variables from acoustics, and of gestures from tract variables), and a model that uses the stress and rhythm of natural language (prosody) to disambiguate confusable sentences. Recent application successes include: 3
* Speech recognition for talkers with cerebral palsy. The automatic system, suitably constrained, outperforms a human listener. 3
* Retrieval of broadcast television segments in four languages, based on queries specified in the international phonetic alphabet. The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took third place in this international competition, and was the only finalist from the United States. 3
* Automatic detection and labeling of non-speech audio events. The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took first place in this international competition. 3
* Teaching Chinese. Software and methods developed by Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson, together with his colleagues from Linguistics and Psychology, are being tested in Mandarin language classrooms at the University of Illinois. 3
Professor Hasegawa-Johnson typically supervises one or two undergraduate research projects per year, thesis research preferred. Past student theses include automatic recognition of musical genre, factorial HMMs for the automatic recognition of speech in music backgrounds, prosody-dependent speech recognition, image source modeling of room impulse response, sonorancy classification for automatic language ID, phonetic landmark detection for automatic language ID, and digital field recorder for acquisition of a natural audio database. 2

Kris Hauser is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research interests lie in robot planning and control, a field devoted to providing the decision-making capabilities needed for robots and other intelligent agents to perform complex physical tasks. His research builds upon the theoretical foundations of state space dynamics and optimality, but attempts to overcome the shortcomings of classical theory when faced the complexities of real-world systems, such as high dimensionality, uncertain dynamics, bounded computation, and integration with perception and learning. The methodologies at the foundation of this work include optimization, probabilistic methods, AI, control theory, and physics simulation, and theory is bridged with practice on real-world physical robots in the context of a diverse range of applications with social impact, including robot locomotion and manipulation, medical robots, human-operated robots, warehouse automation, and intelligent vehicles. 2
Prof. Hauser received his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2008, bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from UC Berkeley in 2003, and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley. He then joined the faculty at Indiana University from 2009-2014, where he started the Intelligent Motion Lab, and then joined the faculty of Duke University from 2014-2019. Prof. Hauser is a recipient of a Stanford Graduate Fellowship, Siebel Scholar Fellowship, Best Paper Award at IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Robots 2015, the NSF CAREER award, and two Amazon Research Awards. He also works as a consultant for Google's autonomous driving company, Waymo. 2

It is far more important to inspire students to learn by creating curiosity than merely transmitting the knowledge to students so that they can be lifelong learners both during school years and after graduation. In order to achieve the goal of educating lifelong learners, creating curiosity is critical. I define curiosity as a powerful tool for students to explore new knowledge in order to satisfy their internal desires. Curiosity is about incubating the desire for students to ask why something happens. Asking why indicates that students are thinking. Then, it is a lot easier for students to get on the journey of exploring theories behind the scenes. Curiosity means having fun while mastering the hurdles. Curiosity injects perseverance into students during the dark times before the sunshine comes. Curiosity is about the desire to appreciate and maximize the benefits of differences. Can you imagine a world where everything is the same? It sounds like the world is going to be so plain. It is the differences that make things pop up. During my teaching career, I have been very curious about the puzzle about how to enable students to learn better. Teaching is also a learning process. I am curious about learning updated thoughts from young students, where I can help students better by understanding them better. 0

Andrew Appel is Eugene Higgins Professor Computer Science, and served from 2009-2015 as Chair of Princeton's CS department. His research is in software verification, computer security, programming languages and compilers, and technology policy. He received his A.B. summa cum laude in physics from Princeton in 1981, and his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1985. Professor Appel has been editor in chief of ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems and is a fellow of the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). He has worked on fast N-body algorithms (1980s), Standard ML of New Jersey (1990s), Foundational Proof-Carrying Code (2000s), and the Verified Software Toolchain (2010-present). 2
I am an active member both of the U.S. computer science education community and of the community of researchers into the psychology of programming. I have participated in the yearly ACM Special Interest Group Symposium on Computer Science Education, either as paper presenter, panelist, or workshop or tutorial presenter, since 1990, and was a member of the 1999 conference program committee. I serve on the editorial board of Computer Science Education, a primary forum for CS education research. I have coauthored papers presented at the biennial Empirical Studies of Programmers (ESP) conference and have served on the program committees of ESP and all the International Computing Education Research Workshops. My interests have long included online learning environments for programming instruction. More recently, I and my colleagues have developed several lab-centric courses, which trade lecture and discussion time for supervised hands-on lab time. All activities for these courses are delivered online, and include embedded assessments and online and o✏ine collaboration as well as more traditional programming tasks. Ongoing work includes the testing of a lab-centric data structures course, development of tools for curriculum authoring, feedback gathering, and revision, along with analysis of class survey and performance data. 2

Alessandro Chiesa was born in Varese, Italy, in 1987. He joined the EECS faculty at UC Berkeley in the summer of 2015 and currently conducts research in the areas of complexity theory, cryptography, and security, focusing on the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of zero knowledge proofs that are short and easy to verify. Chiesa is an author of libsnark, a C++ library for zkSNARKs, which is the leading open-source library for succinct zero knowledge proofs. He is a co-inventor of Zerocash, a new protocol that provides a privacy-preserving version of a cryptocurrency, and a co-founder of Zcash, a digital currency with strong privacy features. Both endeavors rely on libsnark. He is also a co-founder and chief scientist at StarkWare Industries, which uses succinct, transparent, zero knowledge cryptographic proofs to solve the inherent problems of blockchains – scalability and privacy. Before coming to Berkeley, Chiesa spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich, hosted by Thomas Holenstein. He studied Theory of Computation at CSAIL in MIT, where he earned his his M.Eng. in 2010, advised by Eran Tromer and Ron Rivest, and his Ph.D. in 2014, advised by Silvio Micali. He earned B.S. degrees from MIT in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2009. 2

Ruzena Bajcsy is the NEC Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. She was the founding director of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) in 2001, a multicampus organization comprising 4 campuses: UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Merced. As part of her activities in CITRIS, and together with the University of California Center for the Humanities, she played a founding role in establishing a program of Digital Humanities. Before joining UC Berkeley, she headed the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate at the National Science Foundation (1999–2001). From 1972 to 2001 she was a professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania, where she established in 1978 the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) Lab. As director of the GRASP lab she fostered interdisciplinary research activities and attracted faculty from electrical and mechanical engineering as well as psychology/cognitive science and of course computer science. Throughout her 28 years at UPenn she worked on robotics research, including computer vision, tactile perception, and in general the problem of system identification. She also worked on medical imaging, and developed with her students a digital anatomy atlas coupled with elastic matching algorithms that made it possible to automatically identify anatomic structures of the brain, first in X-ray tomography, later with MRI and positron image tomography. Use of this technology is now standard in medical practice. Dr. Bajcsy is a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1997) and National Academy of Medicine (1995) as well as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). In 2001 she received the ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award, and in November 2002 she was named one of the 50 most important women in Discover Magazine. She is the recipient of the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Sciences (2009) and the IEEE Robotics and Automation Award (2013) for her contributions in the field of robotics and automation. Her current research is in the use of robotic technology, namely measuring and extracting noninvasively kinematic and dynamic parameters of individual in order to assess their physical movement capabilities or limitations. If there are limitations, her students have designed assistive devices that can compensate for the lack of kinematic agility and /or physical strength.

From 1972 to 2001 she was a professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania, where she established in 1978 the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) Lab. As director of the GRASP lab she fostered interdisciplinary research activities and attracted faculty from electrical and mechanical engineering as well as psychology/cognitive science and of course computer science. Throughout her 28 years at UPenn she worked on robotics research, including computer vision, tactile perception, and in general the problem of system identification. She also worked on medical imaging, and developed with her students a digital anatomy atlas coupled with elastic matching algorithms that made it possible to automatically identify anatomic structures of the brain, first in X-ray tomography, later with MRI and positron image tomography. Use of this technology is now standard in medical practice. Dr. Bajcsy is a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1997) and National Academy of Medicine (1995) as well as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

I'm an assistant professor in the School of Information at UC Berkeley, where I work on applying natural language processing and machine learning to empirical questions in the humanities and social sciences. My research often involves adding linguistic structure (e.g., syntax, semantics, coreference) to statistical models of text. As such, I'm especially interested in developing core NLP techniques for a variety of languages and domains (e.g., literary text, social media). Before Berkeley, I received my PhD at Carnegie Mellon (School of Computer Science, Language Technologies Institute) and was a senior researcher at the Perseus Project of Tufts University. 2

People solve challenging computational problems every day, making predictions about future events, learning new causal relationships, or discovering how objects should be divided into categories. My research investigates how this is possible, first identifying the nature of the underlying computational problems, and then examining whether we can explain aspects of human behavior as the result of approximating optimal solutions to those problems. Since many of the problems people face in everyday life are problems of induction, requiring inferences from limited data to underconstrained hypotheses, these optimal solutions draw on methods developed in statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence research. Exploring how these methods relate to human cognition provides connections between these fields and cognitive science, as well as a way to turn insights obtained from studying people into new formal techniques. 2

The overall goal of my research is to introduce software techniques to accelerate the design of electromechanical systems: changing the way we design, what components we use, and what machines we use to fabricate them with. 1
Modern electronic designs are increasingly complex systems with many specialized processing engines. The complexity of these systems and the severe physical constraints imposed by technology scaling are limiting the hardware efficiency gains possible using traditional manual design. Automated exploration of much larger design spaces is required to uncover further efficiency gains, but will require a much higher level of design description to avoid restricting the set of possible design solutions while maintaining architect productivity. I am working on a set of techniques for accelerating the entire hardware design cycle. 1
Despite new computer controlled machines that theoretically speed up fabrication of mechanical systems, 3D design remains difficult and fabrication remains manually intensive. In order to address this, I am exploring the ideas of {\it shape compilers} as well as the application of declarative design methods to the design and fabrication of articulated forms to make design and fabrication dramatically more productive. Shape compilers are software applications which transform a high level design into simple and inexpensive parts ready for rapid manufacturing. 1

Pieter Abbeel joined the faculty at UC Berkeley in Fall 2008, with an appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. His research focuses on robotics, machine learning and control. Professor Abbeel has won various awards, including the Sloan Research Fellowship, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Program (AFOSR-YIP) award, the Okawa Research Grant, the 2011 TR35, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) Early Career Award, and the Dick Volz Best U.S. Ph.D. Thesis in Robotics and Automation Award. He has developed apprenticeship learning algorithms which have enabled advanced helicopter aerobatics, including maneuvers such as tic-tocs, chaos and auto-rotation, which only exceptional human pilots can perform. His group has also enabled a robot to reliably pick up randomly shaped, crumpled pieces of laundry and fold them. His work has been featured in many popular press outlets, including BBC, The New York Times , MIT Technology Review , Discovery Channel, SmartPlanet and Wired . 2

Babak Ayazifar joined the EECS faculty at UC Berkeley in 2005, where he is now a Teaching Professor. He earned his BS in EE from Caltech, and his SM and PhD in EECS from MIT. His dissertation, Graph Spectra and Modal Dynamics of Oscillatory Networks , uses spectral graph theory to explore how a network's topology influences its dynamics. At MIT, Babak received the Harold L. Hazen Award for outstanding teaching (1995). He advanced to the rank of Instructor-G , which conferred teaching assignments ordinarily reserved for faculty (1996). He won the Goodwin Medal —MIT's most prestigious award for a graduate student who "has performed above and beyond the norm, and whose teaching efforts can truly be characterized as `conspicuously effective'" (1999). In spring 2002, he was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in MIT’s School of Engineering, teaching a graduate course in Digital Signal Processing. Prior to his arrival at Berkeley, Babak was a Technical Specialist in the Intellectual Property and Technology Group of Ropes & Gray, LLP in Boston. His patent prosecution and related activities spanned a range of technologies, such as mechanical devices, intravascular MRI, DNA Microarray data analysis, and encrypted communication using chaotic systems. Babak is a patent agent, registered to practice before the US Patent and Trademark Office (Reg. No. 56793). Babak is co-inventor on the patent Method and apparatus for providing scalable compressed video signal : U.S. Patent no. 5,387,940 . This stemmed from his work as an Associate Member of the Technical Staff in the Communications Research Laboratory at David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton. At Berkeley Babak has focused on teaching, student learning, curriculum development and reform, mentoring TAs, and sharing his pedagogical innovations and insight at conferences, workshops, and other forums. In 2008 Babak received the UC Berkeley Electrical Engineering Division's Outstanding Teaching Award . And he received the 2012 IEEE Education Society’s Mac Van Valkenburg Early Career Teaching Award . His citation reads "For creative, lively, challenging, and caring teaching that has sparked broad excitement and engagement among his students, even in the largest core courses." From Jan 2013 to Jul 2014 Babak spent an extended sabbatical as a Visiting Senior Lecturer at MIT-EECS, where he was the instructor for 6.041/6.431: Probabilistic Systems Analysis and a recitation instructor for 6.02: Digital Communication Systems . Babak is a member of Tau Beta Pi , the National Engineering Honor Society , and Eta Kappa Nu, the EE Honor Society . He has been a faculty co-advisor for Tau Beta Pi since 2009.

The overall goal of my research is to introduce software techniques to accelerate the design of electromechanical systems: changing the way we design, what components we use, and what machines we use to fabricate them with. Modern electronic designs are increasingly complex systems with many specialized processing engines. The complexity of these systems and the severe physical constraints imposed by technology scaling are limiting the hardware efficiency gains possible using traditional manual design. Automated exploration of much larger design spaces is required to uncover further efficiency gains, but will require a much higher level of design description to avoid restricting the set of possible design solutions while maintaining architect productivity. I am working on a set of techniques for accelerating the entire hardware design cycle. Despite new computer controlled machines that theoretically speed up fabrication of mechanical systems, 3D design remains difficult and fabrication remains manually intensive. In order to address this, I am exploring the ideas of {\it shape compilers} as well as the application of declarative design methods to the design and fabrication of articulated forms to make design and fabrication dramatically more productive. Shape compilers are software applications which transform a high level design into simple and inexpensive parts ready for rapid manufacturing. 2

Ruzena Bajcsy is the NEC Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. She was the founding director of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) in 2001, a multicampus organization comprising 4 campuses: UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Merced. As part of her activities in CITRIS, and together with the University of California Center for the Humanities, she played a founding role in establishing a program of Digital Humanities. Before joining UC Berkeley, she headed the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate at the National Science Foundation (1999–2001). From 1972 to 2001 she was a professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania, where she established in 1978 the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) Lab. As director of the GRASP lab she fostered interdisciplinary research activities and attracted faculty from electrical and mechanical engineering as well as psychology/cognitive science and of course computer science. Throughout her 28 years at UPenn she worked on robotics research, including computer vision, tactile perception, and in general the problem of system identification. She also worked on medical imaging, and developed with her students a digital anatomy atlas coupled with elastic matching algorithms that made it possible to automatically identify anatomic structures of the brain, first in X-ray tomography, later with MRI and positron image tomography. Use of this technology is now standard in medical practice. Dr. Bajcsy is a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1997) and National Academy of Medicine (1995) as well as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). In 2001 she received the ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award, and in November 2002 she was named one of the 50 most important women in Discover Magazine. She is the recipient of the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Sciences (2009) and the IEEE Robotics and Automation Award (2013) for her contributions in the field of robotics and automation. Her current research is in the use of robotic technology, namely measuring and extracting noninvasively kinematic and dynamic parameters of individual in order to assess their physical movement capabilities or limitations. If there are limitations, her students have designed assistive devices that can compensate for the lack of kinematic agility and /or physical strength.

I'm an assistant professor in the School of Information at UC Berkeley, where I work on applying natural language processing and machine learning to empirical questions in the humanities and social sciences. My research often involves adding linguistic structure (e.g., syntax, semantics, coreference) to statistical models of text. As such, I'm especially interested in developing core NLP techniques for a variety of languages and domains (e.g., literary text, social media). Before Berkeley, I received my PhD at Carnegie Mellon (School of Computer Science, Language Technologies Institute) and was a senior researcher at the Perseus Project of Tufts University. 2

Brian A. Barsky is Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley with faculty affiliations in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS), Optometry, Vision Science, Bioengineering, Berkeley Institute of Design (BID), Berkeley Center for New Media (BCNM), Arts Research Center (ARC), and Berkeley Canadian Studies Program. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Optometry (F.A.A.O.), a UC Berkeley Presidential Chair Fellow, a Warren and Marjorie Minner Faculty Fellow in Engineering Ethics and Professional/Social Responsibility, and an ACM Distinguished Speaker. Dr. Barsky was a recipient of an IBM Faculty Development Award and a National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award. He attended McGill University, Montréal, received a D.C.S. in engineering and a B.Sc. in mathematics and computer science. He studied computer graphics and computer science at Cornell University, Ithaca, where he earned an M.S. degree. His Ph.D. is in computer science from the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. His research interests include computational aesthetics, computational photography, methods for the design and fabrication of contact lenses, computer methods for optometry and ophthalmology, image synthesis, spline curve/surface representations, computer aided geometric design and modeling, CAD/CAM/CIM, interactive and realistic three-dimensional computer graphics, visualization in scientific computing, computer aided cornea modeling and visualization, videokeratography techniques, corneal topographic mapping, medical imaging, virtual environments for surgical simulation, and display technology. He developed Vision-Realistic Rendering using three-dimensional rendering techniques for the computer generation of synthetic images to simulate the vision of specific individuals based on measuring the wavefront aberrations of their eyes. This led to developing a vision-correcting display to enable specific viewer to see it in sharp focus directly without using any corrective eyewear such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. This was selected by Scientific American as one of 2014's ten "World Changing Ideas." 2

This led to developing a vision-correcting display to enable specific viewer to see it in sharp focus directly without using any corrective eyewear such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. This was selected by Scientific American as one of 2014's ten "World Changing Ideas." 2

Manuel Blum 0
recursive function, cryptographic protocols, program checking 3
Manuel Blum is a pioneer in the field of theoretical computer science and the winner of the 1995 Turing Award in recognition of his contributions to the foundations of computational complexity theory and its applications to cryptography and program checking, a mathematical approach to writing programs that check their work. He was born in Caracas, Venezuela, where his parents settled after fleeing Europe in the 1930s, and came to the United States in the mid-1950s to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While studying electrical engineering, he pursued his desire to understand thinking and brains by working in the neurophysiology laboratory of Dr. Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts, then concentrated on mathematical logic and recursion theory for the insight it gave him on brains and thinking. He did his doctoral work under the supervision of Artificial Intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky, and earned a Ph.D. from MIT in mathematics in 1964. Blum began his teaching career at MIT as an assistant professor of mathematics and, in 1968, joined the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley. He became the Bruce Nelson University Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon in 2001. Blum has supervised the theses of 35 doctoral students who now pepper almost every major computer science department in the country. The many ground-breaking areas of theoretical computer science chartered by his academic descendants are legend. 2

He serves on several editorial boards, prize committees, and governing boards, including the Board of the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), where he was Chair from 2017 until 2019. Borgs is author of about 140 research papers and inventor of about 30 patents. His current research focuses on the science of networks, including mathematical foundations, particularly the theory of graph limits (which he co-invented about 15 years ago), graph processes, graph algorithms, and applications of graph theory from economics to systems biology. Borgs is also well known for his earlier work on mathematical statistical physics, including the theory of first-order phase transitions and finite-size effects. He was one of the first to apply methods from mathematical statistical physics to problems in theoretical computer science, including phase transitions in combinatorial optimization, and the study of Markov chains. He has recently begun to work on aspects of responsible AI, from differential privacy to questions of bias in automatic decision making. 2
He worked at Microsoft Research for over 22 years, where he started in 1997 as co-founder and co-director of the Theory Group. In 2008, he co-founded Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a lab that brings together traditional CS and statistics research with economics as well as qualitative social science research. Borgs was Deputy Managing Director of this lab from 2008 until he left Microsoft for Berkeley in 2020. Borgs holds a Ph.D. in mathematical physics from the University of Munich and a Habilitation in mathematical physics from the Free University in Berlin. He was the C4 chair of Statistical Mechanics at the University of Leipzig before founding the Microsoft Research theory group. Among the honors he has received are the Karl-Scheel Prize of the German Physical Society, and the Heisenberg Fellowship of the German Research Council. Borgs has twice been a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He is a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

He received his M.S. and Ph.D. in EECS from MIT, and a B.S. in EECS from UC Berkeley. He was named a "Global Leader for Tomorrow" by the World Economic Forum, by the Industry Standard as the "most influential person on the architecture of the Internet" by InfoWorld as one of their top ten innovators, by Technology Review as one of the top 100 most influential people for the 21st century (the "TR100"), and by Forbes as one of their 12 "e-mavericks", for which he appeared on the cover. Dr. Brewer focuses on all aspects of Internet-based systems; including technology, strategy, and government. As a researcher, he has led projects on scalable servers, search engines, network infrastructure, sensor networks, and security. His current focus is on (high) technology for developing regions, with projects in Cambodia, India, Ghana, Mexico, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh (so far), and including communications, health, education, and e-government. In 1996, he co-founded Inktomi Corporation with a Berkeley grad student based on their research prototype, and helped lead it onto the Nasdaq 100 before it was bought by Yahoo! in March 2003. In 2000, he founded the Federal Search Foundation, a 501-3(c) organization focused on improving consumer access to government information. Working with President Clinton, Dr. Brewer helped to create FirstGov.gov, the official portal of the Federal government, which launched in September 2000. Effective July 1, 2014, Professor Brewer is 50%-time with the University and also serving as a leader at Google. 2

Alessandro Chiesa was born in Varese, Italy, in 1987. He joined the EECS faculty at UC Berkeley in the summer of 2015 and currently conducts research in the areas of complexity theory, cryptography, and security, focusing on the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of zero knowledge proofs that are short and easy to verify. Chiesa is an author of libsnark, a C++ library for zkSNARKs, which is the leading open-source library for succinct zero knowledge proofs. He is a co-inventor of Zerocash, a new protocol that provides a privacy-preserving version of a cryptocurrency, and a co-founder of Zcash, a digital currency with strong privacy features. Both endeavors rely on libsnark. He is also a co-founder and chief scientist at StarkWare Industries, which uses succinct, transparent, zero knowledge cryptographic proofs to solve the inherent problems of blockchains – scalability and privacy. Before coming to Berkeley, Chiesa spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich, hosted by Thomas Holenstein. He studied Theory of Computation at CSAIL in MIT, where he earned his his M.Eng. in 2010, advised by Eran Tromer and Ron Rivest, and his Ph.D. in 2014, advised by Silvio Micali. He earned B.S. degrees from MIT in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2009. 2

Education (EDUC) , Computer science education: learning environments and activities 3
I am an active member both of the U.S. computer science education community and of the community of researchers into the psychology of programming. I have participated in the yearly ACM Special Interest Group Symposium on Computer Science Education, either as paper presenter, panelist, or workshop or tutorial presenter, since 1990, and was a member of the 1999 conference program committee. I serve on the editorial board of Computer Science Education, a primary forum for CS education research. I have coauthored papers presented at the biennial Empirical Studies of Programmers (ESP) conference and have served on the program committees of ESP and all the International Computing Education Research Workshops. My interests have long included online learning environments for programming instruction. More recently, I and my colleagues have developed several lab-centric courses, which trade lecture and discussion time for supervised hands-on lab time. All activities for these courses are delivered online, and include embedded assessments and online and o✏ine collaboration as well as more traditional programming tasks. Ongoing work includes the testing of a lab-centric data structures course, development of tools for curriculum authoring, feedback gathering, and revision, along with analysis of class survey and performance data. 2

Anca runs the InterACT lab, focusing on enabling robots to work with, around, and in support of people. Her goal is for robots to autonomously generate their behavior in a way that moves beyond functionality and formally accounts for interaction with humans. This combines optimal control, machine learning, and cognitive science, with applications in collaborative manipulation and autonomous driving. Anca got her PhD in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University on planning intent-expressive robot motion. 2

Michael A. Harrison was born in Philadelphia, PA. He earned his BS and MS in electrical engineering and computing at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, and his PhD in communication sciences from the University of Michigan. He was assistant professor at the University of Michigan from 1963 to 1966. He joined the UC Berkeley faculty as an associate professor from 1966 to 1971 and became a full professor in 1971. He retired in 1994. He has authored seven books and over 200 technical publications in a variety of areas. He was initially interested in switching and automata theory which shifted towards automata theory and discrete systems while at Berkeley. This led to work in the 1960s on formal language theory and ultimately its application to fast parsing methods for compilers as well as getting the fastest practical algorithm for general context free recognition. He became interested in software research and developed the HRU security model in 1975 (named after its authors Harrison, Ruzzo, Ullman), a simple abstract model of protection in operating systems which had far-reaching consequences. He co-founded Gain Technology with his graduate student Pehong Chen, to build multimedia software for UNIX workstations in 1989. It was acquired by Sybase in 1992. He currently splits his time between research in multimedia authoring systems and software environments, various start-up ventures in Silicon Valley, and charitable interests. 2

William "Velvel" Kahan was born in Canada and attended the University of Toronto for both his undergraduate and graduate studies in mathematics, and was eventually hired there as a professor. He joined the Berkeley faculty in 1968 with a joint appointment in the Math Department and as a member of the new Computer Science Department in the College of Letters and Science--before it merged with the EECS Department in the College of Engineering in 1973. He retired from the University in 2008. Kahan was instrumental in creating the IEEE 754-1985 standard for floating-point computation in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He developed a program called "paranoia' in the 1980s to test for potential floating point bugs and developed the Kaham summation algorithm which helps minimize errors introduced when adding a sequences of finite precision floating point numbers. Kahan won the ACM A.M. Turing Award in 1989. 2
